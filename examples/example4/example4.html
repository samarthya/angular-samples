            <h1>How do we add a new directive?</h1>

            <div>
                <p>The way Angular simplifies problems for you is mind boggling.</p>
                <blockquote>What I have done here is I have added a new directive that can be added anywhere, but since I wanted it to be a navigation item to redirect back to home page I have added it as the top.</blockquote>

                Can you spot the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-home" aria-hidden="true"></span> icon at the top?
                <p>
                    <blockquote><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right">&nbsp;AECM</span></blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children. Differently put; A directive is just a function which executes when the compiler encounters it in the DOM.
                    <br/>There are many different types of directives the ones that I have used is the ELEMENT and COMMENT (like the one below - Can you spot the copyright information?</p>
            </div>
        
        <p>Angular's HTML compiler allows the developer to teach the browser new HTML syntax. The compiler allows you to attach behavior to any HTML element or attribute and even create new HTML elements or attributes with custom behavior. Angular calls these behavior extensions directives.</p>
