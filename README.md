Today I added service script and learned something about angular service's provider and factories.

>**All Services are singletons;** they get instantiated once per app. They can be of any type, whether it be a primitive, object literal, function, or even an instance of a custom type.

>The value, factory, service, constant, and provider methods are all providers. They teach the Injector how to instantiate the Services.
